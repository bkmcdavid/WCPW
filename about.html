      <strong>About the Workshop:</strong><br>
      The West Coast Plato Workshop (WCPW) is an annual meeting of Plato scholars from around the world. Founded in 2008 as a grassroots organization, the Workshop reflects the West Coast’s commitment to a community-based approach to scholarship. Each year, a different university along the coast plays host, as participants focus on a particular Platonic dialogue and share research, commentary, and conversation.
      <br><br>
      WCPW is known for its welcoming and genuine atmosphere, where discussions are open, lively, and often continue long after the formal sessions have ended. The format is simple: select a text, gather a group, and let the community shape the direction of inquiry. Leadership and organization rotate, reinforcing the idea that the workshop itself is the collective good, tended by those who gather to participate.
      <br><br>
      Over the years, the Workshop has become a home for Plato enthusiasts at every stage—from seasoned professors to students new to ancient philosophy. It continues to thrive as a space for intellectual exchange, collaboration, and the joyful work of thinking about Plato together.
